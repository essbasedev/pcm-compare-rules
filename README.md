# PCM Compare Rules

## Introduction
This repo contains python code that helps to compare the PCM rules.

There might be scenarios an organization may run multiple instances of the PCM and want to sync the rules and rulesets between the instances.  Comparing the changes between the instances are very cumborsome as Oracle doesn't offer such functionality other than extracting the rules from System Reports -> Program Documentation as PDF, Excel, Word, XML or HTML.

This tool tries to fulfil the needs of the people who wants to compare the extracted rules and rulesets between different POVs or between different applications.

*this readme document would be updated, as and when there's progress..*
